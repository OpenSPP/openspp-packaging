                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 29 June 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


  This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

  0. Additional Definitions.

  As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

  "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

  "Application" refers to any work that makes use of an interface
provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the
Library.  Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is
deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.

  "Combined Work" refers to a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

  "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

  "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

  2. Conveying this License along with the Library.

  You may convey a copy of the Library in plain source code or as an
object file under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above, provided that you
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,
which must be distributed under the terms of sections 1 and 2 above on
a medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If you convey the Library as object code, you must accompany it with
a written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
copy of the machine-readable source code for the Library among the
software that accompanies the object code, or (2) access to copy the
machine-readable source code from a network server at no charge.

  You must ensure that the recipient receives a copy of this License
along with the Library.  You may charge a fee for the physical act of
transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty
protection in exchange for a fee.

  3. Giving Network Access to the Corresponding Source.

  Your rights under section 2 of this License are limited to instances
where the recipient of the Library can also access the complete
machine-readable corresponding source code from the same network
server at no charge.

  4. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that published version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
Library.
